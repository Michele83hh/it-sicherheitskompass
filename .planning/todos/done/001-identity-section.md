# Add identity/branding to landing page

**Area:** landing-page
**Phase:** 7 (Polish + Deploy)
**Created:** 2026-02-06
**Source:** Design review feedback

## Description
Add subtle "who is behind this" element to the landing page:
- Footer hint with developer name
- Optional: Small claim/subline in header area ("IT-Security-Beratung für KMU" or similar)
- Keep it minimal — this is a portfolio/Bewerbungsprojekt, not a company site yet

## Context
Two independent design reviews noted that it's unclear who provides the service. For a Bewerbungsprojekt, a simple name attribution suffices. Full company branding comes later when the business exists.
